Implementation of 3 different real world problems in C++

##### All my codes were tested to work for every test case with a score of 100/100 and efficiency as 100%. 
P.S. I finally got a very high grade in this course ;)

## Problem 1
Sorting the whole struct according to different conditions. The complexity should not be n^2. Customized Merge Sort was used by me here.

## Problem 2

Building a Trie data structure using the given dictionary containing thousands of english words. Each of the operation adding, removing, searching for the word should be accurate and efficient.


## Problem 3

Constructing a family tree based on Graphs. Using C++ STL library to build graphs and then developing algorithms to search for descendants in the tree using Depth First Search and searching for related people using Breadth First Search. However the classical algos need to be modified heavily to do so. This was the most challenging problem in the course.
